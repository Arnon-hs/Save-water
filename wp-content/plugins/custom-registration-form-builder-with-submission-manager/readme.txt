= So, what exactly is RegistrationMagic? =

RegistrationMagic is a powerful WordPress plugin that gives you TOTAL CONTROL of user registrations on your website. You can create different forms for user registrations, each with different pre-defined fields. You can also set up payments for paid registrations. A Front-End user area allows your users to login, reset password, check their transactions, download submissions etc.

RegistrationMagic tracks all incoming form submissions and activities which you can monitor from dashboard, making informed decision about form changes. You can also accept attachments (single or multiple), and view/ download them from single area in the dashboard. Advanced filters allow you to see form submissions for specific form and time. 

There’s also a fully fledged User Managed module integrated with RegistrationMagic. It goes a step ahead of default WordPress User manager by connecting registration and payment activities with individual user accounts. 

In short, RegistrationMagic is the missing user registration system for WordPress and a powerful addition to any WordPress admin’s arsenal.

And that’s not all! RegistrationMagic is in active development with new features being rolled out every fortnight. If you feel anything is missing, just request our team and you may see it in the very next release!
