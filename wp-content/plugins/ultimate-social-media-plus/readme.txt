Super-easy to use and 100% FREE social media plugin which adds social media icons to your website with tons of customization features! 

== Description ==

***The plugin is now ready for translation. If you speak a different language than English, please help us translate it! It's easy. Please email us at support at ultimatelysocial dot com and let us know to which language you want to translate it to. Thank you!***

This plugin is based on https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/, giving it even more functions and making it even easier to use at the same time.  

It's still 100% FREE and allows you to display social media icons on your website and tailor them to your needs. 

You can add icons for RSS, Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube, "Share" (covering 200+ other social media platforms) and upload custom icons of your choice. 

Additional features in this plugin: 

- You can place icons also before posts 
- You can place the icons next to your posts also on your homepage
- You can also choose to display the icons you picked before/after posts (not just a standard set)
- Placing the icons is easier than before (new third question) 
- Several bugs fixed

As with its predecessor, you can: 

- Pick from 16 different designs for your icons
- Give several actions to one icon (e.g. your facebook icon can lead visitors to your Facebook page, and also give visitors the opportunity to like your page)
- Decide to give your icons an animation (e.g. automatic shuffling, mouse-over effects) to make your visitors aware of them, increasing the chance that they follow/share your blog
- Allow visitors to subscribe to your blog by Email 
- Add "counts" to your icons
- Decide to display a pop-up (on all or only on selected pages) asking people to follow/share you
- Select from many other customization features

The plugin is very easy to use as it takes you through the process step by step. Check out the screenshots.
